# CZI randomizer

## goal: randomize filenames to avoid researcher's bias

## language: windows script

## steps

 - generates new folder with current date
 - within that folder a translation table
 - searches recursively for files with CZI extension
 - copies these pictures into new folder and renames them with random names
 - keeps track of these changes in the translation table
 
 # CIZ ReOrganizer

## goal: restructure the files and contain in filename the folder structure

## requirements: md5.bat

## language: windows script

## steps

 - generates new folder with current date
 - within that folder log file
 - searches recursively for files with CZI extension
 - copies these pictures into new folder and renames them with filename + folder structure
 - keeps track of these changes in the log file
 
# CIZ Fixer

## goal: if files cant be associated anymore (e.g. table is lost), this helps to re-associate them via md5 sum

## language: windows script

## steps

### Expected situation:

 1.	Our main folder in which we have 
  a.	A number of folder with subfolders containing files in CZI
  b.	The script “CZI_Randomize”
  c.	The script “CZI_ReOrganizer”
 2.	One folder within that main folder as result of “CZI_Randomizer” which contains random filenames which cant be associated anymore

### Steps to fix situation:

 1.	Temporarily move the folder with non-associable random files outside of your main folder
 2.	Run the program “CZI_ReOrganizer” in the main folder (this generates a new folder with the date and a filename reflecting the folder structure)
 3.	Create in the main folder a new folder called e.g. fixAssociation 
 4.	Copy the folder generated by CZI_ReOrganizer (with current date) into that folder
 5.	Copy the folder with with non-associable random files (see point 1) into the “fixAssociation” folder
 6.	Copy the “CZI_fixer” and “md5” in the “fixAssociation” folder & execute the CZI_fixer
 7.	Import the generated csv file “associationTable.csv” into Excel
 8.	Sort the table by column2 which is the md5 sum
